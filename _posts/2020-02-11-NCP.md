# Overview
## Sewage
Sewage is the mixture of liquid, faeces, toilet paper and food wastes produced by people. The liquid in sewage includes urine (piss) and wastewater which comes from the toilet, the kitchen, bathroom and laundry. Sewage contains lots of disease-causing germs and parasites. Sewage is treated to get rid of as much of the solid matter as possible. The remaining liquid is called effluent.
## Sewage disposal
Getting rid of sewage and effluent is called sewage disposal. If sewage is not disposed of or contained correctly people may come into contact with it and get very sick.

There are different ways to dispose of sewage. Whichever method is used, it is important to make sure that it does not:

* cause dangerous conditions which allow people to come into contact with disease-causing germs
* cause pollution of a water supply
* allow the breeding of insects such as mosquitoes or cockroaches which can carry disease-causing germs inside or on their bodies as a result of eating or walking in sewage
* produce bad smells

## Disease from sewage
Disease-causing germs can be spread from sewage if it is not disposed of properly or if people do not practise proper toilet hygiene (cleanliness). If a sewage disposal system is not properly maintained it will not be able to get rid of the sewage safely. For a sewage system to be properly maintained, all faulty (blocked, damaged, broken or worn-out) parts must be mended as soon as possible after they stop working correctly.

Viruses, unlike bacteria, require a living host to reproduce. They cannot reproduce outside of a host cell and thus will not grow in wastewater.

There have been a number of studies of viral infections in sewage work- ers. The overall conclusion seems to be that if workers are properly trained and properly protected, then the actual risk of developing viral infections via occu- pational exposure is very low, according to (Clark 1987, West and Locke 1990).

In sewer systems, HIV is subjected to environmental factors to which it is simply not suited: wrong pH, too low temperature, and the presence of surfactants and other chemicals (Gerardi, M. H., Maczuga, A. P., and Zimmerman, M. C. 1988).

There are viruses like Norovirus, Coxsackieviruses and Poliovirus in sewers that may cause problems (Forsgren, A., & Brinck, K. 2016).

# How Diseases Spread Through the Fecal-Oral Route
When the disease spreads through the fecal-oral route, it means that contaminated feces from an infected person are somehow ingested by another person.

Usually, the situation occurs when an infected person might forget to properly wash his hands after using the toilet. Anything he or she touches afterward might be contaminated with microscopic germs that other people may encounter.

Proper handwashing is the best defense.


# What happened in Hong Kong, 2003? The “Fecal Droplet” Route
Reports by the World Health Organization (WHO) have shed new light on the role sewage plays in spreading the deadly disease known as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. The issue emerged following a SARS outbreak at the Amoy Garden apartment complex in Hong Kong. According to WHO, ineffective U-trap seals in the drainpipes of Amoy Garden apartments triggered the SARS outbreak. These traps, often called P-traps in the U.S., are designed to hold water at all times. The water acts as a barrier and prevents insects, foul smells and, in this case, viruses and bacteria from backing up through the drains. When the P-trap failed in the Amoy Garden apartment complex in Hong Kong, the plumbing system, in effect, acted as a transportation system for the virus to spread quickly through the building.

Droplets originating from virus-rich excreta in a given building’s drainage system re-entered into resident’s apartments via sewage and drainage systems where there were strong upward air flows, inadequate “traps” and non-functional water seals, according to WHO.

In the absence of proper maintenance and without consistent monitoring, reviewing, enforcing and updating of building standards and practices, inadequate plumbing and sewage systems could continue to enhance the potential of SARS and some other diseases to spread. However, it would be relatively easy to interrupt and avoid some diseases, including SARS if it were to return.


## Plumbing Tips for Preventing the Spread of Disease:
* Push water through floor drains in bathrooms, basements, garages and other areas at least once a month to keep the P-traps filled with water and to prevent insects, air or anything else from passing through pipes.
* Run a gallon of water through bathroom drains about once a month, since mopping floors clean - the usual technique in the U.S., as in China - does not allow enough water to fill the P-trap causing it to dry out.
* Run a gallon of water at least once a month through lesser-used drains to keep P-trap seals from drying out.
* Pour up to a cup of chlorine bleach or other common disinfectants down a drain to kill germs since WHO has determined that they kill most bacteria and viruses, including SARS, within five minutes. But be sure to later flush the drain with water.
* Odors that arise from household drains indicate the P-traps are dry and need to be filled with water.
* Visit the [WHO Web site](www.who.int) to see test results showing how the SARS virus can live for days in human waste.

## Plumbing and Drainage in Hong Kong Since Then
Under working and test conditions traps should retain a minimum seal of 25mm of water or equivalent. Self priming type drainage traps or drainage pipe connections which ensure trap priming may be considered, e.g. connection of washbasin discharge to the pipe between the floor drain grating and its U-trap. Care should also be taken to prevent back-flowing at the floor drain.

Where mechanical ventilation in the form of extractor fan is provided, such as in bathrooms and lavatories, care should be taken to ensure that water seals are intact and operate according to the design intent. Consideration should be given to the quality and quantity of air intake, air-flow path and fan capacity.The Environmental Health Team of the World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised that the optimum volume for bathroom ventilation is 2 cfm/sq ft (10.2 l/s per sq. metre). WHO is of the view that a larger volume does not add much on the comfort side and has the hidden risk of building up negative pressure. Designers are advised to provide an opening to bathrooms and lavatories for make-up air, such as an undercut to the door or an opening with a louvre at the door or wall, in order to minimise the build-up of negative pressure where an extractor fan is used for ventilation. The airflow path created should avoid circuiting of the ingress and exhaust air.

# How about Ebola?

[CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/prevention/faq-untreated-sewage.html)：
## Can sanitary sewers be used for the disposal of Ebola-contaminated patient waste?
A sanitary sewer is a system of underground pipes that carries sewage and wastes from homes and other buildings to a wastewater treatment plant for disposal. The World Health Organization (WHO) states sanitary sewers may be used for the safe disposal of waste, such as feces, urine, or vomit, from patients with Ebola.

At this time, there have been no reports of Ebola spreading through sewage. In the United States, wastewater treatment processes are designed to inactivate or remove infectious agents, making it unlikely that Ebola virus could spread through sewers.

## Why can sanitary sewers be used for waste disposal from Ebola patients?
In the United States, human waste, blood, and other potentially infectious materials are routinely released into sanitary sewers. Wastewater treatment plant processes are designed to inactivate or remove human disease-causing organisms (pathogens), including bacteria, viruses, protozoa (such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium), and helminthes (parasitic worms).

Workers directly handling sewage pipes and in the prescreening stage of wastewater treatment are at the highest risks for exposure to disease-causing organisms. These workers should follow the guidelines provided in the CDC Interim Guidance for Managers and Workers Handling Untreated Wastewater from Suspected or Confirmed Individuals with Ebola in the U.S. to prevent exposure to Ebola when working with untreated wastewater.

## Have enveloped viruses like Ebola been transmitted to wastewater treatment plant workers?
In an enveloped virus, such as Ebola, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV, the core of the virus is surrounded by a lipoprotein outer layer. This lipoprotein envelope makes enveloped viruses more susceptible to destruction by numerous physical and chemical agents than viruses without a lipoprotein envelope (called non-enveloped viruses, e.g., norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus).

Several studies have investigated wastewater treatment plant workers for evidence of infection or prevalence of antibodies (antibodies are proteins that are produced by the body’s immune system when it detects harmful substances). The studies looked at both enveloped viruses and enteric non-enveloped viruses that can affect the gastrointestinal tract (stomach).

A few studies evaluated the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B, parainfluenza virus, and hepatitis C. Studies found a significantly higher prevalence of anti-hepatitis B virus antibodies in wastewater treatment plant workers, but other risk factors were not taken into account, such as sexual behavior, injection drug use, or possible exposure in the healthcare environment. These factors could have influenced the study results. Other studies reported a significantly higher prevalence of antibodies towards parainfluenza virus type 1. Another study reported two cases of hepatitis C in wastewater treatment plant workers. There have been no other published reports of infections of wastewater treatment plant workers with bloodborne pathogens such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV, or other enveloped viruses such as Ebola or influenza.


# Will NCP Recover from Wastewater?
2019-nCoV RNA (NCP) has been detected in a stool specimen collected on day 7 of the patient’s illness, according to a case report published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, [First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191?query=featured_home). 'However, extrapulmonary detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present, and the clinical significance of the detection of viral RNA outside the respiratory tract is unknown at this time', the authors stated.
