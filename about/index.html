				<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=100% SHADE>
				<p>I'm Biao Huang, an associate Prof. of Ningbo University, China.</p>
				<p>My research interests include <B><I>urban drainage</I></B>, <B><I>environmental hydraulics</I></B>, <B><I>multiphase flow</I></B>, and <B><I>CFD applications in these fields</I></B>.</p>
				<p>Currently I'm working on projects that aim to monitoring and modeling urban drainage systems.</p>
				<h1>Urban Drainage Group</h1>
				<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=100% SHADE>
				<p>We focus on urban hydrosystem security and sustainability at present.</p>
				<h1>Dept. of Urban HydroSystem Science & Engineering</h1>
				<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=100% SHADE>
				<p>Urban Hydrosystems Science and Engineering focuses on technical areas of hydrology, hydraulics, water resources engineering and environmental fluid dynamics, on the urban scale, which are interdisciplinary fields that synthesize knowledge from a wide range of subjects.</p>
				<p>The department at NBU receives government funding for a wide range of educational and research efforts with opportunities available for undergraduate and graduate students and researchers. Field, laboratory, data analysis and modeling studies are available. Students are also encouraged to obtain courses and training in topic areas such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), geographical information systems (GIS), numerical computing, machine learning, water policy and management, and advanced data analysis techniques. Students who major in Urban Hydrosystems Science and Engineering go on to have careers in the fields of water resources engineering, hydraulics, environmental remediation, sustainability and various others in the private or public sectors. Joint doctoral/post-doctoral programs (Ningbo University, China, and University of Alberta, Canada) are also available to interested students.</p>
				<p>This department is led by <B><a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/faculty/david-zhu">Dr. David Z. Zhu</a></B>.</p>
